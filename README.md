This repository contains an exploratory data analysis and clustering project focused on a comprehensive Pokémon dataset. 
Using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we reduce the dimensionality of the data to uncover inherent patterns and group Pokémon based on their characteristics in a lower-dimensional space. 
This approach enables us to visualize complex relationships and discover interesting clusters among Pokémon species, potentially revealing insights into their stats and types.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the Pokémon dataset for analysis.
PCA Implementation: Applying PCA to reduce the dataset's dimensions while retaining essential features.
Clustering Analysis: Using clustering algorithms post-PCA to group Pokémon and analyze the clusters.
Visualization: Creating plots and graphs to visualize the clustering results and the PCA process.
This project aims to provide Pokémon enthusiasts and data science professionals with insights into Pokémon characteristics and offer a methodological approach to dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis.
